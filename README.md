### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, Iâ€™m Alan, and I am a developer, designer, photographer and dad.

Iâ€™ve worked through all stages of the development life-cycle for a broad range of clients spanning many industry sectors. I find myself more at home creating user-friendly, well-crafted front-end experiences with a strong focus on usability, performance, and maintainability.

I have been a developer for over 15 years and spent many years working with .NET (C#). Over the last 6 years I have embraced Ruby, and have found myself working on more Rails projects. During 2020 I started learning iOS development and released 2 apps to the app store.

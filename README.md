### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve worked through all stages of the development life-cycle for a broad range of clients spanning many industry sectors. I find myself more at home creating user-friendly, well-crafted front-end experiences with a strong focus on usability, performance, and maintainability.

I have been a developer for over to 15 years and spent many years working with .NET (C#). In ore recent times I have embraced Ruby and Swift, and have found myself favouring Rails for the majority of my projects. Throughout 2020 I will be branching out in to iOS development to exapnd my skillset.
